Growing up with immigrant parents from West Africa, I learned the value of perseverance and determination. My mother always instilled in me the belief that "people can take anything from you - except for your skills.” This was a driving force behind my decision to pursue a career in technology. I’m passionate about using my technical skills to solve real-world problems. I enjoy working collaboratively --> do you have an example of working collaborative with others?

with others to bring to life new ideas that make a positive impact on communities like the ones I come from. I’m excited to join a team of like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS
